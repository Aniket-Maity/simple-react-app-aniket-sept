            <p className = "font-weight-normal">A carbon footprint is the total greenhouse gas 
            (GHG) emissions caused by an individual, event, organization, service, 
            place or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.[1] Greenhouse gases, 
            including the carbon-containing gases carbon dioxide and methane, can be emitted through 
            the burning of fossil fuels, land clearance and the production and consumption of food, 
            manufactured goods, materials, wood, roads, buildings, transportation and other services.[2] 
            The term was popularized by a $250 million advertising campaign by the oil and gas company 
            BP in an attempt to move public attention away from restricting the activities of fossil fuel 
            companies and onto individual responsibility for solving climate change</p>
